This is the PRIVATE GunMod project repository

Forge Version: 678
Minecraft Version: 1.5.1

In here, we will host all the source files for the project, in order for the team to develop together.
We will also store the textures in this repository, to have a single storage point for easy access for the team.

When a team member wishes to make a new change to the code(bugfix/feature), one should make a fork of the project, then a branch of that fork, and add changes to the new branch.
When the changes are done, make a pull request, to merge you branch changes into the main project. The repository admin(jacob) would then review and accept the changes into the main branch.

Keep in mind, that all code added to this project, is planned to get released as open-source when the mod have gained some popularity.
